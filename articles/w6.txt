<h2>Monday Feb 13, Meeting, Discord (Week 6)</h2>
<p>Today we met to discuss possible ideas for the project. A survival/communications balloon concept was chosen after a brief dialogue. We felt that this concept was the most dynamic, useful in multiple scenarios, and could fit into a 13 foot shipping box. Ideally, the balloon would act as a beacon for someone in danger. Also, we imagine that it can support other technologies that we discussed today - such as solar panels and communication hardware. The fabric balloon shell can also be repurposed as a tarp, blanket, or bag depending on the disaster/survival context.</p>
